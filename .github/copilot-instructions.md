# Copilot Instructions

## PR and Commit Convention

- PR title and commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- The PR title should describe what the change does. Use the conventional-commit prefix as the PR title prefix.
- For commits, use the commit body to explain why the change was made and any important implementation notes.
- PR descriptions should be concise: what changed, why, and any migration steps or risk notes. Reference related issues using `#<issue-number>`.
